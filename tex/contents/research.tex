\subsection{Trace Visualization}

\cvline{SoC-Trace Project}%
{I work on the SoC-Trace project, which gathers academics like INRIA, LIG 
laboratory, and industrial partners like STMicroelectronics, Probayes or 
Magillem. The main objective of this project is to analyze multimedia 
application behavior, running on multicore architectures, and be able to detect 
behavior disruptions responsible of streaming flow perturbations. My research 
are related to visualization of traces provided by these software execution, and 
are mainly focused on aggregation and interaction solutions, in order to enable 
the analyst to deal with big amounts of data and screen limitations. The aim is 
to propose an overview technique solving both time and space scalability issues, 
used as an entry point to the analysis, and giving the user a way to focus on 
interesting parts of the trace.}
