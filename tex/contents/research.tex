\subsection{Trace Visualization}

\cvline{\textbf{SoC-Trace Project}}%
{I am currently working in the SoC-Trace project, which gathers academics like 
Inria, LIG 
laboratory and Grenoble University, and industrial partners like 
STMicroelectronics, Probayes and 
Magillem Design Systems. My research focuses on the visualization of traces 
provided by 
the execution of embedded multimedia applications, in order to analyze their 
behavior. I propose solutions based on data aggregation to provide scalability 
and help the analysis of traces that contain a lot of information.}

\cvline{\textbf{SONGS\\Project}}%
{I am also involved in the SONGS project, funded by the French 
National Research Agency, and focused on the simulation of large parallel 
systems. This project gives me the opportunity to extend the analysis 
techniques I design to the parallel application scope.}
