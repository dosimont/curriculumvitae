\subsection{Trace Visualization}

\cvline{SoC-Trace Project}%
{I work in the SoC-Trace project, which gathers academics like INRIA, LIG 
laboratory, and industrial partners like STMicroelectronics, Probayes or 
Magillem. My research focuses on the visualization of traces provided by 
the execution of embedded multimedia applications, in order to analyze their 
behavior. I propose solutions based on data aggregation to provide scalability 
and help the analysis of traces that contain much information.}

\cvline{SONGS\\Project}%
{I am also involved in the SONGS project, funded by the French 
Research National Agency, and focused on the simulation of large parallel 
systems. This project gives me the opportunity to extend the analysis 
techniques I design to parallel applications.}
