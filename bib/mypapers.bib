	abstract = {Today, because of computing system complexity, it is required to trace application executions to understand their behavior. Visualization techniques provide some help in representing their content, but their scalability is limited both because of human perception and bounded screen resolution. To solve this issue, we propose a visualization based on time aggregation that provides a concise overview of a trace whatever its size. The level of details in this visualization can be configurable by users who can adjust the compromise between concision (gain from aggregation) and information loss. They can then refine their analysis by zooming in an interesting part and choosing a less aggregated overview for this interesting part. This visualization is implemented in our tool, Ocelotl, which enables users to interact with this visualization by changing the selected time interval and its aggregation settings dynamically. The results presented in this paper show that the technique can help users correctly identify anomalies in very large trace files composed of up to forty million events.},

	abstract = {The growing complexity of embedded system hardware and software makes their behavior analysis a challenging task. In this context, tracing appears to be a promising solution as it provides relevant information about the system execution. However, trace management and analysis are hindered by several issues like the diversity of trace formats, the incompatibility of trace analysis methods, the problem of trace size and its storage as well as by the lack of visualization scalability. In this paper we present {FrameSoC}, a new trace management infrastructure that solves all the above issues together. It provides generic solutions for trace storage and defines interfaces and plugin mechanisms for integrating diverse analysis tools. We illustrate the benefit of {FrameSoC} with a case study of a visualization module that enables representation scalability of large traces by using an aggregation algorithm.},
